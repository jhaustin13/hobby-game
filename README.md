# hobby-game

The intention with hobby-game was to be the game I worked on whenever I felt the itch to make a game, but it was too ambitious. Its intention was to be a first person procedurally generated open world voxel game. Very much inspired by Minecraft. Here are some of the features I started.

- A marching cubes driven generated terrain. The terrain is editable and can be clicked on broken down, and put back together. Not super intuitive and how it breaks down and places, but works reasonably well.

- A crafting system that tries to model the minecraft crafting grid.

- Beginning of building placement and snapping

- Inventory system and UI picking up and placing in slots

- Trees can be cut down and logs picked up to be used in crafting

- There is an attempt at multithreading the chunk loading of the terrain.

- The rest are various pieces in need of work
